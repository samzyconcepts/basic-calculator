# Assignment 1: Basic Calculator and Conditional Flow

## Write a Python program that:

- Prompts the user to input two numbers.
- Asks the user to choose an operator (+, -, \*, /) for the calculation.
- Uses conditional statements to validate the operator and perform the appropriate arithmetic operation.
- Handles invalid operators and displays an error message.
- Checks for division by zero if the operator is / and gracefully handles the error.
